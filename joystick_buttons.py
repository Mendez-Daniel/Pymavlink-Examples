"""
Example of how to connect Pymavlink to an autopilot using a UDP in order to determine if certain joystick buttons have been pressed.

Requirements for use in BlueOS:
- You need to create a MAVLink Endpoints in BlueOS, type UDP Client. Example IP 192.168.2.1:14770.
- It is necessary to use the MAVLink router "MAVP2P" to route data, as the MANUAL_CONTROL message will not appear when the joystick is connected.

NOTAS:
All system components that communicate via MAVLink are expected to send a HEARTBEAT message at a constant rate of at least 1 Hz.

The MANUAL_CONTROL message define the target system to be controlled, the movement in four primary axes (x, y, z, r) and two extension axes (s, t), and two 16-bit fields to represent the states of up to 32 buttons (buttons, buttons2).

The axis values can range from -1000 to 1000. The button values are represented by integer values.

Examples of button messages
Button 3 pressed: 4 -> 0b0000000000000100
Button 1 and 5 pressed: 17 -> 0b0000000000010001
